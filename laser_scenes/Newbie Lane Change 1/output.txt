Input Interpretation (Text):
1. Your vehicle (VUT) is in the leftmost lane (lane 1) of a 4-lane highway.
    - Reasoning: This sets the initial position of the VUT.
2. In the right front (lane 2), there is a vehicle (Vehicle B) that is decelerating.
    - Reasoning: This vehicle's deceleration affects the subsequent behavior of the other vehicle (Vehicle C) and the VUT.
3. Behind Vehicle B, there is another vehicle (Vehicle C) attempting to change lanes to the leftmost lane (lane 1).
    - Reasoning: This action causes a potential conflict with the VUT.
4. Due to the deceleration of Vehicle B, Vehicle C has to slow down and cannot complete the lane change before the VUT passes, causing a collision.
    - Reasoning: This sets the stage for the collision and indicates the sequence of events leading to it.

Explanation:
- The VUT starts in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
- Vehicle B starts in lane 2, 70 meters from the finish line, moving at 5 m/s, and decelerates to 3 m/s.
- Vehicle C starts in lane 2, 80 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s, attempts to change lanes to lane 1, decelerates to 5 m/s, and continues moving straight without completing the lane change before the VUT passes, resulting in a collision.
