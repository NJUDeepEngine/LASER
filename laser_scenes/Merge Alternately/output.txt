### Input Interpretation:
1. The two cars are traveling in the right lane of a two-lane road approaching an intersection.
2. Car B (the following car) notices a collision between Car A (the leading car) and another vehicle in the right lane.
3. To avoid the collision, Car B merges into the left lane.
4. The vehicle under test (VUT) is initially traveling in the right lane behind Car B.
5. The VUT continues to travel straight after Car B merges into the left lane.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial States**:
   - **VUT** starts at lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
   - **Car_A** starts at lane 1, 103 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
   - **Car_B** starts at lane 1, 105 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
   
2. **Car_A**'s Steps:
   - Move straight at 10 m/s until it reaches 80 meters (indicating approaching the intersection).
   - Stop due to a collision event in the right lane.

3. **Car_B**'s Steps:
   - Move straight at 10 m/s until it notices the collision ahead.
   - Change lanes from lane 1 to lane 2 to avoid the collision.
   - Continue moving straight in the left lane at 10 m/s until the end of the scene.

4. The VUT continues traveling straight at 10 m/s, initially behind Car B, and maintains its course after Car B changes lanes.
