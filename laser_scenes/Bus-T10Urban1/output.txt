### Input Interpretation

- **Stage 1**: The bus is initially driving in the middle lane (lane 2) at a certain speed.
  - **Reasoning**: The bus needs to start in the middle lane to later change to the bus stop on the side.
  
- **Stage 2**: The bus changes lanes from lane 2 to lane 3 to reach the bus stop.
  - **Reasoning**: The bus needs to stop at the side bus stop which is located on the side of the road (lane 3).

- **Stage 3**: The bus stops at the bus stop for a short period.
  - **Reasoning**: The bus needs to pick up or drop off passengers at the bus stop.

- **Stage 4**: The bus starts again and changes lanes back to lane 2.
  - **Reasoning**: After finishing at the bus stop, the bus needs to return to the middle lane to continue its route.

- **VUT (Vehicle Under Test)**: 
  - Initial state: (lane 2, 100 meters away from the intersection, speed of 10 m/s)
  - The VUT will continue moving straight ahead at the initial speed.
  
- **Bus**:
  - Initial state: (lane 2, 120 meters away from the intersection, speed of 8 m/s)
  
  - **Step 1**: Change lanes from lane 2 to lane 3
    - Action: "Change lanes from lane 2 to lane 3"
    - Termination condition: "Successfully move to lane 3"
    - Reason: "The bus needs to stop at the side bus stop."
  
  - **Step 2**: Stop at the bus stop
    - Action: "Stop at the bus stop"
    - Termination condition: "Bus remains stationary for 10 seconds"
    - Reason: "The bus needs to pick up or drop off passengers."

  - **Step 3**: Change lanes from lane 3 to lane 2
    - Action: "Change lanes from lane 3 to lane 2"
