### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** The vehicle in front slows down.
   - Reasoning: This is the initial event that triggers the subsequent reactions of the following vehicles.

**Stage 2:** The second vehicle collides with the slowed-down vehicle, causing its speed to drop to zero.
   - Reasoning: The second vehicle fails to avoid the slowed-down vehicle, resulting in a collision.

**Stage 3:** The third vehicle attempts to change lanes to avoid the collision.
   - Reasoning: To prevent a collision with the stopped second vehicle, the third vehicle tries to maneuver into another lane.

**Stage 4:** The third vehicle fails to change lanes and crashes.
   - Reasoning: Despite the attempt to change lanes, the third vehicle is unsuccessful and ends up crashing.
