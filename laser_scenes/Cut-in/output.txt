### Input Interpretation:
1. The scenario takes place on a 4-lane road with a crosswalk near the intersection.
2. The vehicle under test (VUT) is driving straight on lane 1.
3. A second car (the overtaking car) initially starts behind the VUT in lane 2, overtakes the VUT, and then switches to lane 1 in front of the VUT.
4. After overtaking, the car in front slows down.

#### Stage Sequence:
1. **Initial State**: The VUT is driving straight in lane 1.
2. **Overtaking Car Approaches**: The overtaking car is in lane 2, closing the distance to the VUT.
3. **Overtaking Car Switches Lanes**: The overtaking car moves from lane 2 to lane 1 after passing the VUT.
4. **Overtaking Car Slows Down**: The overtaking car reduces its speed once it is in front of the VUT.

                'termination_condition': 'when the car is in leftmost lane ahead of the VUT',

                'termination_condition': "when the car's speed is reduced to 5 m/s",

			}
		]
	}
}
```

### Explanation:
#### VUT Initial State:
- The VUT starts in lane 1, at a distance of 20 meters (from the crosswalk), with an initial speed of 15 m/s.

#### Overtaking Car Initial State:
- The overtaking car starts in lane 2, at a distance of 10 meters (from the crosswalk), with an initial speed of 20 m/s.

#### Steps for Overtaking Car:
1. **Close Distance**:
   - **Action**: Continue driving in lane 2 and close the distance to the VUT.
   - **Termination Condition**: Achieve a position 5 meters behind the VUT.
   - **Reason**: To prepare for an overtaking maneuver.
   
2. **Change Lane**:
   - **Action**: Move from lane 2 to lane 1.
   - **Termination Condition**: Complete the lane change and fully occupy lane 1.
   - **Reason**: To merge in front of the VUT after overtaking.

3. **Slow Down**:
   - **Action**: Slow down.
   - **Termination Condition**: Reduce speed to 10 m/s.
   - **Reason**: To simulate a vehicle slowing down in front of the VUT after overtaking.
