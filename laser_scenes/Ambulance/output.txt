### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** The ambulance (VUT) is driving rapidly in a straight line on the highway. This implies that the VUT is in a hurry, likely due to an emergency, and traveling at a high speed in its current lane.

**Stage 2:** Multiple vehicles in the same lane as the VUT begin to move aside. The vehicles recognize the urgency of the ambulance and are attempting to clear the path by changing lanes or moving to the shoulder.

**Stage 3:** The vehicles continue moving aside until the ambulance has a clear path. Once the ambulance has a clear path, it continues driving straight rapidly until the end of the scene.

### Explanation:

1. **Ambulance (VUT):**
   - Model: Ambulance
   - Initial state: Lane 1, 50 meters from the intersection, traveling at 30 m/s.

2. **Vehicle 1:**
   - Model: Car
   - Initial state: Lane 1, 30 meters from the intersection, traveling at 25 m/s.
   - Steps:
     1. Change from lane 1 to lane 2, terminating when the car is fully in lane 2 and the ambulance is behind it at a safe distance of 5 meters. This ensures the ambulance has enough space to pass safely.
     2. Continue driving in lane 2, terminating when the ambulance has passed and the car is now behind it. This step is to maintain road safety.

3. **Vehicle 2:**
   - Model: Car
   - Initial state: Lane 1, 20 meters from the intersection, traveling at 20 m/s.
   - Steps:
     1. Change from lane 1 to lane 2, terminating when the car is fully in lane 2 and the ambulance is behind it at a safe distance of 5 meters. This ensures the ambulance has enough space to pass safely.
     2. Continue driving in lane 2, terminating when the ambulance has passed and the car is now behind it. This step is to maintain road safety.

4. **Vehicle 3:**
   - Model: Truck
   - Initial state: Lane 1, 10 meters from the intersection, traveling at 15 m/s.
   - Steps:
     1. Change from lane 1 to lane 2, terminating when the truck is fully in lane 2 and the ambulance is behind it at a safe distance of 5 meters. This ensures the ambulance has enough space to pass safely.
     2. Continue driving in lane 2, terminating when the ambulance has passed and the truck is now behind it. This step is to maintain road safety.

This detailed breakdown ensures that the scenario is coherent and logically consistent, with each actor performing actions to facilitate the rapid movement of the ambulance through the highway.
