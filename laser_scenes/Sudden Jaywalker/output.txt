### Input Interpretation:
1. Initial state: The VUT and the truck are moving alongside each other on a 4-lane road.
2. The truck notices a pedestrian ahead at the crosswalk and decides to slow down and stop.
3. The VUT, with its view obstructed by the truck, does not slow down.
4. The pedestrian starts to move forward across the crosswalk.
5. The VUT continues moving forward and hits the pedestrian.

### Explanation:
1. The truck and VUT start moving alongside each other at a speed of 10 m/s.
2. The truck notices the pedestrian ahead at the crosswalk and begins to slow down and eventually stops to let the pedestrian cross.
3. The pedestrian starts to move forward across the crosswalk.
4. The VUT, with its view obstructed by the truck, does not slow down and continues moving forward.
5. The VUT hits the pedestrian as it continues to move forward without slowing down.
