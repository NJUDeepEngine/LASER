Input Interpretation (Text):
1. The scenario begins with the VUT traveling along a 2-lane road approaching an intersection, positioned in the left lane (Lane 1).
   - Reasoning: The VUT is traveling in its designated lane near an intersection.
   
2. A vehicle traveling in the right lane (Lane 2) approaches from behind the VUT.
   - Reasoning: This sets up the initial condition for a sideswipe incident, where the vehicle in the right lane is close enough to interact with the VUT.

3. As the vehicle in the right lane attempts to overtake or maneuver close to the VUT, it accidentally sideswipes the VUT.
   - Reasoning: The vehicle in the right lane either misjudges the space available or loses control, leading to contact with the VUT.

4. The sideswipe occurs near the intersection, where both vehicles are moving towards the crosswalk.
   - Reasoning: The proximity to the intersection and crosswalk indicates that the vehicles might be preparing to either stop or navigate through the crosswalk.
