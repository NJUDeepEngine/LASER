### Input Interpretation:
1. **Initial Event**: The Vehicle Under Test (VUT) malfunctions and comes to a complete stop.
    - Reasoning: The VUT is unable to continue driving due to a malfunction.
2. **Stage 1**: Vehicles in the same lane as the VUT slow down.
    - Reasoning: To avoid collision with the stopped VUT.
3. **Stage 2**: Vehicles in the same lane as the VUT change lanes.
    - Reasoning: To bypass the stopped VUT and continue their journey.
4. **Stage 3**: Vehicles proceed forward in their new lanes.
    - Reasoning: Continue driving safely past the VUT.

### Explanation:
- **VUT**: The Vehicle Under Test is initially stopped in lane 1 at the crosswalk.
- **Vehicle_1**: Initially in lane 1, 10 meters behind the VUT, moving at 15 m/s. It slows down to 5 m/s to avoid collision, changes lanes to lane 2 to bypass the VUT, accelerates back to 15 m/s, and continues moving forward.
- **Vehicle_2**: Initially in lane 1, 20 meters behind the VUT, moving at 15 m/s. It follows a similar sequence: slows down to avoid the slowed-down Vehicle_1, changes lanes to lane 2, accelerates back to 15 m/s, and continues moving forward.
