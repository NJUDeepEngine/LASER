### Input Interpretation:

#### Stage 1: Initial Setup
- Two cars are driving on a 4-lane road.
- Two cars change lanes towards the middle simultaneously.

#### Stage 2: Lane Change
- Both cars move towards the center lanes simultaneously.
- They collide as they enter the same lane.

### Explanation:

#### Initial State:
- **VUT**: In lane 1, 100 meters from the intersection, moving at 10 m/s.
- **Car 1**: In lane 2, 90 meters from the intersection, moving at 10 m/s.
- **Car 2**: In lane 1, 110 meters from the intersection, moving at 10 m/s.

#### Actions:
- **Car 1** changes from lane 2 to lane 1.
- **Car 2** changes from lane 1 to lane 2.
- Both cars move straight ahead until they collide.

Each car has a single lane change action, followed by moving straight ahead until they collide with the VUT. The collision occurs due to both cars moving into the center lane simultaneously.
