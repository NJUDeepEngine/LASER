### Input Interpretation:

Stage 1: The car parked in front of the bus station starts moving.
- Reasoning: This initiates the sequence of events leading to the collision. The car needs to start before it can change lanes.

Stage 2: The car changes lanes.
- Reasoning: The car needs to change lanes, which sets it on a collision course with the bus.

Stage 3: The bus changes lanes to park at the bus station.
- Reasoning: The bus's movement intersects with the car's lane change, leading to the collision.

Stage 4: The car collides with the bus.
- Reasoning: The collision is the final event caused by the interaction of the car and the bus's movements.

### Explanation:

- The Vehicle Under Test (VUT) is a stationary vehicle at the start, located in lane 1, 65 meters from the finish line.
- The car (actor) starts in lane 2, 65 meters from the finish line, parked.
- The bus (actor) starts in lane 1, 30 meters from the finish line, moving towards the bus station.
- The scenario progresses with the car starting, changing lanes, and colliding with the bus as the bus changes lanes to park.
