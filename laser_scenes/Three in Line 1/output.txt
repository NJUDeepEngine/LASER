Input Interpretation:
1. The car at the very front (Car 1) starts to slow down near the intersection.
   - Explanation: This action triggers a chain reaction as the second car (Car 2) needs to adapt.
2. The second car (Car 2) notices the slowing car in front and initiates a lane change to the right to avoid a collision.
   - Explanation: This lane change aims to avoid a rear-end collision with Car 1.
3. The Vehicle Under Test (VUT), positioned behind the second car, observes these actions and needs to respond accordingly.
   - Explanation: The VUT must adjust its speed and possibly its lane position in response to the actions of Car 1 and Car 2.

Scene Breakdown:
- Lane configuration: four lanes, where lanes 1 and 2 are driving lanes leading to the intersection, and lanes 3 and 4 are sidewalks or non-driving lanes.
- Distance configuration: the intersection is 0 meters away from the crosswalk.

### Detailed Steps Breakdown:

- **Car 1**:
    - Initial state: Position in lane 1, 50 meters away from the intersection, moving at a speed of 10 m/s.
    - Step 1: Slow down.
        - Action: Reduce speed.
        - Termination Condition: Speed reduces to 5 m/s.
        - Reason: Approaching the intersection and the crosswalk.

- **Car 2**:
    - Initial state: Position in lane 1, 30 meters away from the intersection, moving at a speed of 15 m/s.
    - Step 1: Initiate lane change to the right.
        - Action: Move from lane 1 to lane 2.
        - Termination Condition: Successfully move to lane 2.
        - Reason: To avoid a collision with Car 1, which is slowing down.

- **Vehicle Under Test (VUT)**:
    - Initial state: Position in lane 1, 10 meters away from the intersection, moving at a speed of 15 m/s.

This setup ensures a coherent and logical driving scenario where each vehicle's actions lead naturally to the next set of responses.
