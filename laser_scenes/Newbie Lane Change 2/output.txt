Input Interpretation:
1. The ego vehicle (Vehicle Under Test, VUT) is traveling on a three-lane highway.
2. There is a truck in lane 1 (to the left of the ego vehicle).
3. There is a car in lane 3 (in the right front) traveling at the same speed as the ego vehicle.
4. The car in lane 3 starts to change lanes to the left (into lane 2, where the ego vehicle is).
5. The car does not accelerate during the lane change, causing the longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and the car to decrease.
6. This results in a collision during the lane change.

Explanation:
- The VUT starts in lane 2, 60 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
- The truck starts in lane 1, 60 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s and maintains its speed throughout the scenario.
- The car starts in lane 3, 65 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
- The car changes lanes from lane 3 to lane 2 without accelerating, causing a collision with the VUT due to the decreasing longitudinal distance.
