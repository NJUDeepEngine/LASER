Input Interpretation:
1. Initial state: The VUT is in the rightmost lane with two cars ahead in the leftmost lane. 
2. Stage 1: The front car in the leftmost lane suddenly decelerates.
   - Reasoning: The sudden deceleration might be due to an obstacle or need to reduce speed significantly for the intersection.
3. Stage 2: The rear car in the leftmost lane swerves to the right into the rightmost lane.
   - Reasoning: The rear car swerves to avoid a collision with the front car.
