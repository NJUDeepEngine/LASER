### Input Interpretation:

1. **Stage 1.** The VUT is driving normally in one of the lanes on a 4-lane road.
   - Reasoning: This sets the initial condition of the VUT, indicating it is in motion and not involved in any overtaking or lane-changing maneuvers initially.

2. **Stage 2.** The VUT notices a particular vehicle attempting to overtake for the first time.
   - Reasoning: This introduces the presence of another key actor (a vehicle) and begins the sequence of its overtaking maneuvers.

3. **Stage 3.** The particular vehicle successfully overtakes another vehicle.
   - Reasoning: This is the first overtaking action by the particular vehicle, which may involve lane changes and acceleration.

4. **Stage 4.** The particular vehicle attempts to overtake another vehicle for the second time.
   - Reasoning: This describes the second overtaking maneuver by the particular vehicle, implying it will move back to its original lane before starting the second overtaking.

5. **Stage 5.** The particular vehicle successfully completes the second overtaking maneuver.
   - Reasoning: This completes the sequence of the particular vehicle's actions and establishes the final state of all vehicles involved.

### Explanation of the Script:

- **VUT:**
  - Initial state: Driving in lane 2, 50 meters from the intersection, at 25 m/s.

- **Vehicle1:**
  - Initial state: Driving in lane 2, 30 meters from the intersection, at 20 m/s.
  - Steps:
    1. Change from lane 2 to lane 1 to prepare for overtaking.
    2. Accelerate until it is more than 5 meters ahead of Vehicle2.
    3. Change back from lane 1 to lane 2.
    4. Continue driving straight until the end of the scene.

- **Vehicle2:**
  - Initial state: Driving in lane 2, 40 meters from the intersection, at 20 m/s.
  - Steps:
    1. Move straight, maintaining the current speed and lane while Vehicle1 completes the first overtaking.
    2. Continue driving straight until the end of the scene.

- **Vehicle3:**
  - Initial state: Driving in lane 2, 60 meters from the intersection, at 22 m/s.
  - Steps:
    1. Move straight, maintaining the current speed and lane while Vehicle1 begins the second overtaking.
    2. Continue driving straight until the end of the scene.
