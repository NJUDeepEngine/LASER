Input Interpretation (Text):
- Stage 1. The scenario begins on a 4-lane highway, where there are three cars traveling: two cars intending to overtake and one car in the middle lane which will be overtaken. The two cars are positioned in different lanes to the left and right of the middle car.
- Stage 2. The two cars plan to overtake the middle car simultaneously. This requires coordination to ensure neither car interferes with the other's maneuver.
- Stage 3. Each overtaking car must change lanes to pass the middle car safely and then return to their original lanes.
- Stage 4. After overtaking, both cars continue to move forward until the end of the scene.
