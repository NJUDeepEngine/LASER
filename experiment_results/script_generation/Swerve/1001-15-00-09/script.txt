### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** 
Initial setup: There are two cars ahead of the VUT on the left side in a 4-lane highway. 
- Car A is the front car.
- Car B is the rear car.
- VUT is behind both cars.

**Stage 2:**
Car A suddenly decelerates. This causes Car B to respond to avoid a collision.

**Stage 3:**
Car B swerves to the right to avoid a collision with Car A. This maneuver impacts the VUT's driving as well.

**Stage 4:**
VUT continues to drive forward.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Setup:**
  - **VUT** is in lane 2, 100 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
  - **Car A** is in lane 2, 40 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
  - **Car B** is in lane 2, 70 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.

- **Car A's Actions:**
  - **Step 1:** Decelerate to a speed of 5 m/s to create a sudden hazard.
  - **Step 2:** Continue moving forward at 5 m/s until the end of the scene.

- **Car B's Actions:**
  - **Step 1:** Swerves from lane 2 to lane 3 to avoid collision with Car A.
  - **Step 2:** Continue moving forward at 10 m/s in the new lane until the end of the scene.

- **VUT's Actions:**
  - No specific actions are defined for the VUT other than its initial state, implying it will need to react to the movements of Car A and Car B.
