**Input Interpretation (Text):**

**Stage 1:** The scene starts with the VUT and two cars ahead of it on the left side. The initial positions and speeds of these vehicles need to be defined.
- **Reasoning:** This sets up the initial state of the scenario.

**Stage 2:** The front car suddenly decelerates.
- **Reasoning:** This causes the rear car to take evasive action to avoid a collision, leading to the next stage.

**Stage 3:** The rear car swerves to the right to avoid colliding with the suddenly decelerating front car.
- **Reasoning:** This action aims to prevent an accident and will involve the rear car changing lanes and continuing to move forward.

**Stage 4:** The VUT continues to move forward, reacting to the changing positions of the two cars ahead.
- **Reasoning:** This ensures that the VUT maintains safe driving practices, adapting to the movements of the other vehicles.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial States:** The VUT is positioned at lane 2, 100 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s. The front car is in the same lane, 20 meters ahead of the VUT, also traveling at 10 m/s. The rear car is 10 meters behind the front car, also in lane 2, traveling at 10 m/s.
- **Front Car:** It decelerates to 5 m/s and then continues at this reduced speed.
- **Rear Car:** It swerves from lane 2 to lane 3 to avoid the front car and then continues to move forward at 10 m/s.
- **VUT:** The VUT will adjust its driving based on the movements of the two cars ahead, ensuring a safe driving response.
