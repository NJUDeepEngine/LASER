### Input Interpretation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The VUT is driving on a 4-lane highway.
   - There are two cars ahead of the VUT in the same lane (leftmost lane).

2. **Stage 1**:
   - The front car (Car A) suddenly decelerates.
   - Reasoning: The front car might have encountered an obstacle or is braking for some reason.

3. **Stage 2**:
   - The rear car (Car B) swerves to the right to avoid a collision with the front car.
   - Reasoning: To prevent a rear-end collision, Car B makes an evasive maneuver by changing lanes.

4. **Stage 3**:
   - The VUT needs to react to the sudden deceleration and lane change of the cars ahead.
   - Reasoning: The VUT should take appropriate actions to maintain safety and avoid collisions.

### Explanation:

- **VUT**:
  - Initial state: Lane 1, 60 meters from the endpoint, traveling at 10 m/s.

- **Car A**:
  - Initial state: Lane 1, 70 meters from the endpoint, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Step 1: Decelerate to 0 m/s.
    - Termination condition: Reach a speed of 0 m/s.
    - Reason: The front car suddenly decelerates.
  - Step 2: Stay stationary.
    - Termination condition: End of scene.
    - Reason: The car has decelerated to a stop and remains stationary.

- **Car B**:
  - Initial state: Lane 1, 65 meters from the endpoint, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Step 1: Change from lane 1 to lane 2.
    - Termination condition: Complete lane change to lane 2.
    - Reason: The rear car swerves to the right to avoid a collision with the front car.
  - Step 2: Move straight ahead at a speed not exceeding 10 m/s.
    - Termination condition: End of scene.
    - Reason: Continue driving after avoiding the collision.

This script provides a coherent and logically consistent description of the scenario, fulfilling the requirements and ensuring the VUT reacts appropriately to the actions of Cars A and B.
