### Input Interpretation:

#### Stage 1: Initial State
- The VUT is driving in a specific lane with two cars ahead on the left side.
- The front car (Car A) is initially driving at a constant speed in the same lane as the VUT.
- The rear car (Car B) is also driving at a constant speed behind Car A.

#### Stage 2: Sudden Deceleration
- Car A suddenly decelerates due to an unspecified reason.
- Car B, which is following Car A, needs to react quickly to avoid a collision.

#### Stage 3: Maneuver to Avoid Collision
- Car B swerves to the right to avoid rear-ending Car A.
- The VUT must observe and react accordingly to the sudden lane change by Car B and the deceleration of Car A.

### Explanation:

- **Initial State**: 
  - The VUT is in lane 2, 50 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Car A is in lane 2, 40 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Car B is in lane 2, 45 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.

- **Car A's Actions**: 
  1. **Decelerate to 5 m/s**:
     - Action: Decelerate to 5 m/s.
     - Termination Condition: Speed reaches 5 m/s.
     - Reason: Sudden deceleration due to an obstacle or traffic condition.
  2. **Move straight ahead at a speed not exceeding 5 m/s**:
     - Action: Move straight ahead at a speed not exceeding 5 m/s.
     - Termination Condition: End of the scenario.
     - Reason: Maintain reduced speed after deceleration.

- **Car B's Actions**:
  1. **Swerve to the right (change from lane 2 to lane 3)**:
     - Action: Swerve to the right (change from lane 2 to lane 3).
     - Termination Condition: Lane change to lane 3 is complete.
     - Reason: Avoid collision with Car A.
  2. **Move straight ahead at a speed not exceeding 10 m/s**:
     - Action: Move straight ahead at a speed not exceeding 10 m/s.
     - Termination Condition: End of the scenario.
     - Reason: Continue driving in the new lane after avoiding the collision.

In this detailed scenario, the VUT must be prepared to respond to the sudden deceleration of Car A and the lane change by Car B, ensuring the coherence and logical consistency of the driving scenario.
