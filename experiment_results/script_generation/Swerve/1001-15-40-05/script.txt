### Input Interpretation:

1. **Stage 1: Initial Setup**
    - There are two cars ahead of the VUT, positioned on the left side.
    - The exact positions and speeds of the VUT and the two cars need to be defined.

2. **Stage 2: Front Car Decelerates**
    - The front car suddenly slows down, which triggers the reaction from the rear car.

3. **Stage 3: Rear Car Swerves**
    - The rear car swerves to the right to avoid a collision with the decelerating front car.

4. **Stage 4: Continuation**
    - The VUT and other actors continue moving after the swerve maneuver.

### Explanation:

- **FrontCar**: Starts in lane 2, 80 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s. It decelerates to 0 m/s and remains stopped for the rest of the scene.
- **RearCar**: Starts in lane 2, 90 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s. It swerves to the right (lane 3) to avoid the decelerating FrontCar and continues moving forward at 10 m/s.
- **VUT**: Starts in lane 2, 100 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.

This setup ensures a coherent and logical sequence of events, with specific termination conditions and clear reasoning for each action. The positions and speeds have been calculated to create a realistic interaction between the vehicles.
