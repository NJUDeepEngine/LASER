Input Interpretation:
    Stage 1: The car parked in front of the bus station starts moving.
        - Reasoning: The car needs to leave its parked position and join the traffic flow.
    Stage 2: The car changes lanes.
        - Reasoning: The car aims to change from its current lane to the adjacent lane.
    Stage 3: The bus changes lanes to park at the bus station.
        - Reasoning: The bus needs to move from its travel lane to the parking lane at the bus station.
    Stage 4: The car collides with the bus.
        - Reasoning: The car and bus are both performing lane changes simultaneously, leading to a collision.
