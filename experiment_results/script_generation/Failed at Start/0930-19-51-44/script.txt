### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1**: The car parked in front of the bus station starts moving.
- Reasoning: The car is initially stationary and needs to start moving before it can perform any further maneuvers.

**Stage 2**: The car changes lanes.
- Reasoning: The car needs to change lanes to presumably maneuver around or ahead of the bus station area.

**Stage 3**: The bus changes lanes to park.
- Reasoning: The bus is initially moving and needs to change lanes to pull into the bus station parking area.

**Stage 4**: The car collides with the bus.
- Reasoning: Due to the simultaneous lane changes, the car and bus end up in the same lane at the same position, leading to a collision.

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The car is parked in lane 2, 65 meters from the finish line, at 0 m/s. The bus is in lane 1, 70 meters from the finish line, moving at 5 m/s.
- **Car**: 
  - **Step 1**: Start moving forward until it reaches a speed of 5 m/s.
  - **Step 2**: Change from lane 2 to lane 1.
  - **Step 3**: Move forward until it collides with the bus.
- **Bus**:
  - **Step 1**: Change from lane 1 to lane 2.
  - **Step 2**: Move forward until it collides with the car.
