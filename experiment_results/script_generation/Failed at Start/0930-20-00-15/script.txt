### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1:**
A car is parked in front of the bus station and begins to move. The car is initially stationary and will start by accelerating to merge into the traffic.

**Reasoning:**
The car needs to start moving from a parked position and then change lanes to merge into traffic.

**Stage 2:**
The car changes lanes from lane 2 to lane 1. 

**Reasoning:**
The car needs to change lanes to maneuver into the traffic flow.

**Stage 3:**
A bus is changing lanes from lane 1 to lane 2 to park at the bus station.

**Reasoning:**
The bus needs to move from a driving lane to a parking lane to reach the bus station.

**Stage 4:**
The car and bus collide during their respective lane changes.

**Reasoning:**
Both the car and the bus change lanes simultaneously, resulting in a collision.
