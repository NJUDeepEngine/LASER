### Input Interpretation:

1. **Initial States**: 
    - A car is parked in front of the bus station in lane 2.
    - A bus is moving in lane 1 and intends to change lanes to park in lane 2.

2. **Stage 1**: 
    - The parked car starts moving in lane 2. 
    - Reasoning: The car begins its journey from the parked state.

3. **Stage 2**: 
    - The car changes from lane 2 to lane 1.
    - Reasoning: The car attempts to merge into lane 1 for some reason (possibly to overtake or leave the bus station).

4. **Stage 3**: 
    - The bus moves straight in lane 1 and begins to change lanes to lane 2 to park.
    - Reasoning: The bus needs to park at the bus station, which is located in lane 2.

5. **Stage 4**: 
    - The car collides with the bus while both are changing lanes.
    - Reasoning: Miscommunication or lack of awareness leads to a collision during the lane-changing maneuvers.
