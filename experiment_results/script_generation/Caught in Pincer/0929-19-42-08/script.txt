### Input Interpretation:

1. **Stage 1:** The car in the left lane (lane 1) is attempting to overtake. 
    - The overtaking car starts from lane 1, moves ahead of the ego vehicle, and then changes to lane 2.
    - This action limits the space in front of the ego vehicle.

2. **Stage 2:** The ego vehicle is forced to decelerate due to the overtaking maneuver.
    - The ego vehicle starts in lane 2, notices the car overtaking from lane 1, and reduces its speed to avoid collision.

3. **Stage 3:** A car behind the ego vehicle is speeding up.
    - The car behind starts in lane 2, accelerates to pressure the ego vehicle to increase its speed.

4. **Stage 4:** The ego vehicle is under pressure to accelerate due to the car behind.
    - The ego vehicle needs to balance its speed due to the car in front and the car behind.

### Explanation:

1. **Overtaking Car:**
    - **Initial State:** In lane 1, 55 meters from the finish line, moving at 12 m/s.
    - **Steps:**
        1. Move straight ahead at 12 m/s until it is 5 meters ahead of the VUT.
        2. Change from lane 1 to lane 2, completing the overtaking maneuver.
        3. Continue moving straight at 12 m/s until the end of the scene.

2. **Car Behind:**
    - **Initial State:** In lane 2, 45 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
    - **Steps:**
        1. Accelerate to a speed not exceeding 15 m/s until it is approximately 2 meters behind the VUT.
        2. Continue moving straight at 15 m/s until the end of the scene.

3. **Vehicle Under Test (VUT):**
    - **Initial State:** In lane 2, 50 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
    - Forced to decelerate due to the overtaking car and pressured to accelerate by the car behind.
