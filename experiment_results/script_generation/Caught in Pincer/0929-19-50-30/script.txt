Input Interpretation (Text):

Stage 1. The car to the left of the ego vehicle (let's call it "LeftCar") is attempting to overtake. This action limits the space in front of the ego vehicle (VUT), forcing the VUT to decelerate to avoid collision.
    Reasoning: "LeftCar" is moving into the VUT's lane, reducing the space available for VUT to maintain its speed safely.

Stage 2. The car behind the VUT (let's call it "BehindCar") is speeding up and pressuring the VUT to accelerate.
    Reasoning: "BehindCar" is increasing its speed and closing the gap with the VUT, making it difficult for the VUT to decelerate without risking a rear-end collision.

Stage 3. The VUT must balance between decelerating to avoid the "LeftCar" and accelerating to avoid being hit by "BehindCar."
    Reasoning: The VUT needs to adjust its speed carefully to navigate the conflicting pressures from both "LeftCar" and "BehindCar."
