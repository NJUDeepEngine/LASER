### Input Interpretation

1. **Stage 1: Car on the left attempts to overtake the ego vehicle.**
   - Objective: The car on the left (Actor 1) accelerates and changes lanes to overtake the ego vehicle (VUT).
   - Reasoning: Actor 1 wants to move ahead of the VUT, which occupies the right lane (lane 2).

2. **Stage 2: Actor 1 completes the overtaking maneuver, limiting space in front of the VUT.**
   - Objective: Actor 1 finishes lane change and continues forward, reducing the longitudinal distance to the VUT.
   - Reasoning: Actor 1 finishes overtaking and settles in lane 2 in front of the VUT.

3. **Stage 3: The VUT decelerates due to reduced space in front.**
   - Objective: The VUT slows down to avoid collision with Actor 1.
   - Reasoning: The VUT needs to maintain a safe following distance.

4. **Stage 4: Car behind the VUT speeds up, pressuring the VUT to accelerate.**
   - Objective: The car behind (Actor 2) speeds up and approaches the VUT, creating pressure on the VUT to increase speed.
   - Reasoning: Actor 2 aims to move faster along the highway, potentially preparing to overtake.

5. **Stage 5: The VUT accelerates to maintain speed due to pressure from behind.**
   - Objective: The VUT increases speed to avoid being too slow relative to Actor 2.
   - Reasoning: To maintain a safe distance both in front and behind, balancing between Actor 1 and Actor 2.

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - **VUT:** In lane 2, 60 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
   - **Actor 1:** In lane 1, 65 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
   - **Actor 2:** In lane 2, 50 meters from the finish line, moving at 8 m/s.

2. **Actor 1 (Car on the left):**
   - **Step 1:** Accelerates straight ahead until it is 5 meters ahead of the VUT.
   - **Step 2:** Changes from lane 1 to lane 2.
   - **Step 3:** Moves straight ahead until the end of the scene.

3. **Actor 2 (Car behind):**
   - **Step 1:** Accelerates straight ahead until it is within 5 meters behind the VUT.
   - **Step 2:** Moves straight ahead until the end of the scene.

This setup ensures that Actor 1 successfully overtakes the VUT, leading the VUT to decelerate. Actor 2 then speeds up, pressuring the VUT to accelerate, maintaining a coherent and logical sequence of events.
