### Input Interpretation:

#### Stage 1: Car to the left attempts to overtake
- The car in lane 1 (let's call it "Left Car") attempts to overtake the ego vehicle (referred to as VUT) by moving into lane 2.
- This action reduces the space in front of the VUT.

#### Stage 2: VUT decelerates
- Due to the reduced space in front, the VUT is forced to decelerate to avoid a collision with the Left Car.

#### Stage 3: Car behind speeds up
- A car behind the VUT (let's call it "Rear Car") speeds up, creating pressure for the VUT to accelerate.

                "termination_condition": "Rear Car is close to the VUT with a longitudinal distance of 5 meters",
                "reason": "To pressure the VUT to accelerate"
            },
            {
                "action": "Move forward with speed of 15 m/s",
                "termination_condition": "End of the scene",
                "reason": "Continue driving after pressuring the VUT"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This scenario reflects the interactions between the VUT, the Left Car, and the Rear Car, detailing the sequence of actions and termination conditions for each actor.
