### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1**: Initialization
- The scene begins with a truck in lane 1 (leftmost lane), the ego vehicle in lane 2 (middle lane), and a car in lane 3 (rightmost lane).
- All vehicles start at different positions but travel at the same speed.

**Stage 2**: Lane Change Initiation by the Car
- The car in lane 3 starts to change lanes to lane 2.
- The car does not accelerate during the lane change, causing the longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and the car to decrease.

**Stage 3**: Collision
- Due to the decreasing longitudinal distance during the lane change, a collision occurs between the ego vehicle and the car.

**Explanation**:
- **VUT (Vehicle Under Test)**: Starts in lane 2, at 60 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
- **Truck**: Starts in lane 1 (leftmost lane), at 65 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s. It maintains its speed throughout the scene.
- **Car**: Starts in lane 3 (rightmost lane), at 55 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s. It changes to lane 2 without accelerating, causing a collision with the VUT.
