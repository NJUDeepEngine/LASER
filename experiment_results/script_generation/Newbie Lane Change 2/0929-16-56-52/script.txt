**Input Interpretation (Text):**

Stage 1. The scenario begins with the ego vehicle (Vehicle Under Test, VUT) traveling on a three-lane highway in lane 2. To its left, in lane 1, there is a truck traveling parallel at the same speed. Ahead of the VUT in lane 3, there is a car traveling at the same speed as the VUT.

Stage 2. The car in lane 3 begins a lane change to the left, attempting to move into lane 2. The car does not accelerate during this maneuver.

Stage 3. Due to the lack of acceleration and the lane change maneuver, the longitudinal distance between the car and the VUT decreases, resulting in a collision during the lane change.
