## Input Interpretation:

### Stage 1:
- The ego vehicle (Vehicle Under Test, VUT) is traveling in lane 2 (middle lane) of a three-lane highway.
- To the left of the VUT, there is a truck traveling in lane 1 (left most lane).
- In lane 3 (right most lane), there is a car traveling at the same speed as the VUT.

### Stage 2:
- The car in lane 3 begins to change lanes to the left, moving into lane 2.

### Stage 3:
- The car does not accelerate during the lane change.
- As a result, the longitudinal distance between the VUT and the car decreases.

### Stage 4:
- Due to the decrease in longitudinal distance, a collision occurs between the VUT and the car during the lane change.
