### Input Interpretation:

#### Stage 1:
- **Description**: The scenario starts with the vehicle under test (VUT) traveling on a 2-lane road.
- **Reasoning**: This sets the initial conditions for the scenario.

#### Stage 2:
- **Description**: A car begins to overtake the VUT by changing from lane 1 to lane 2.
- **Reasoning**: The car needs to move to the adjacent lane to begin overtaking the VUT.

#### Stage 3:
- **Description**: The car accelerates to move ahead of the VUT.
- **Reasoning**: By increasing its speed, the car can pass the VUT.

#### Stage 4:
- **Description**: Once the car is at least 5 meters ahead of the VUT, it changes back to lane 1.
- **Reasoning**: The car needs to return to its original lane after overtaking.

#### Stage 5:
- **Description**: The car slows down after overtaking.
- **Reasoning**: The car reduces its speed, completing the overtaking maneuver.

#### Stage 6:
- **Description**: Both the VUT and the overtaking car continue moving forward until the end of the scene.
- **Reasoning**: This ensures the scenario plays out until the end.
