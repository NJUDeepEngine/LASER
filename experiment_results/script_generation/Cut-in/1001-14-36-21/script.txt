### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** 
- **Description:** A car starts behind the vehicle under test (VUT) in the same lane.
- **Reasoning:** The car must be in a position where it can attempt to overtake the VUT.

**Stage 2:** 
- **Description:** The car changes lanes to the left (from lane 1 to lane 2) to begin the overtaking maneuver.
- **Reasoning:** To overtake, the car must move into the adjacent lane to pass the VUT.

**Stage 3:** 
- **Description:** The car accelerates to a speed higher than the VUT to overtake it.
- **Reasoning:** The car needs to gain a longitudinal position of at least 5 meters ahead of the VUT.

**Stage 4:** 
- **Description:** Once the car is more than 5 meters ahead of the VUT, it changes lanes back to the original lane (lane 2 to lane 1).
- **Reasoning:** The car returns to its original lane after successfully overtaking.

**Stage 5:** 
- **Description:** The car slows down after overtaking the VUT.
- **Reasoning:** The car reduces its speed after the overtaking maneuver.

**Stage 6:** 
- **Description:** The VUT continues to move straight at a constant speed.
- **Reasoning:** The VUT is maintaining its speed and direction throughout the scenario.

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - VUT: (1, 100, 10) - The VUT is in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
   - Car1: (1, 110, 8) - Car1 is in lane 1, 110 meters from the finish line, moving at 8 m/s.

2. **Car1's Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Car1 changes lanes from lane 1 to lane 2 to initiate the overtaking.
   - **Step 2:** Car1 accelerates to overtake the VUT, moving to a speed not exceeding 15 m/s until it is more than 5 meters ahead of the VUT.
   - **Step 3:** Car1 changes lanes back to lane 1 after overtaking.
   - **Step 4:** Car1 slows down to a speed not lower than 5 m/s after successfully overtaking the VUT.
   - **Step 5:** Car1 maintains a constant speed of 10 m/s until the end of the scene.

3. **VUT's Continuous Action:**
   - The VUT continues moving at a constant speed of 10 m/s in lane 1 throughout the scenario.
