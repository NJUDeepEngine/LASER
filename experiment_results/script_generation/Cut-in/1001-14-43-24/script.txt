### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** The vehicle under test (VUT) is driving in its lane on a 2-lane road.
  - Reasoning: This sets the initial condition for the scenario.

**Stage 2:** Another car approaches the VUT from behind in the same lane.
  - Reasoning: For overtaking to occur, the approaching car must start from a position behind the VUT.

**Stage 3:** The approaching car changes lanes to the left lane to initiate the overtaking maneuver.
  - Reasoning: The car needs to move to the adjacent lane to overtake the VUT safely.

**Stage 4:** The approaching car accelerates to get ahead of the VUT by more than 5 meters.
  - Reasoning: Overtaking requires the approaching car to increase its speed and pass the VUT.

**Stage 5:** The approaching car changes lanes back to the original lane in front of the VUT.
  - Reasoning: Completing the overtaking maneuver involves returning to the original lane.

**Stage 6:** The approaching car slows down after getting in front of the VUT.
  - Reasoning: This sets the final condition where the overtaking car reduces speed after the maneuver.

### Explanation:

- **VUT (Vehicle Under Test) Initial State:** Starts in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
- **Overtaking Car Initial State:** Starts in lane 1, 120 meters from the finish line, traveling at 12 m/s.
- **Step-by-Step Actions of the Overtaking Car:**
  1. Change from lane 1 to lane 2 to initiate overtaking.
  2. Accelerate to a position more than 5 meters ahead of the VUT.
  3. Change back to lane 1 in front of the VUT.
  4. Decelerate to a speed of 8 m/s after overtaking.
  5. Continue moving straight ahead at 8 m/s until the end of the scene.
