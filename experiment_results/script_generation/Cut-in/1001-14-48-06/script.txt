Input Interpretation:
1. The vehicle under test (VUT) is driving in one of the lanes on a 2-lane road.
2. Another car (let's call it "Car A") starts behind the VUT.
3. Car A changes lanes to overtake the VUT.
4. Car A accelerates until it is more than 5 meters ahead of the VUT.
5. Car A changes back to the original lane in front of the VUT.
6. Car A slows down after overtaking the VUT.
