### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1: Initial State and Setup**
- The scenario occurs on a 2-lane road.
- The vehicle under test (VUT) is driving in one of the lanes.

**Stage 2: Car Approaching**
- Another car starts some distance behind the VUT in the same lane.

**Stage 3: Lane Change to Overtake**
- The approaching car changes lanes to overtake the VUT.

**Stage 4: Overtaking**
- The car accelerates to pass the VUT.

**Stage 5: Lane Change Back**
- The car changes back into the original lane in front of the VUT after overtaking it.

**Stage 6: Slow Down**
- The car slows down after overtaking the VUT.

**Stage 7: Continue Moving Forward**
- Both vehicles continue moving forward until the end of the scene.

### Summary
- The VUT (Vehicle Under Test) starts in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
- Car1 starts in lane 1, 150 meters from the finish line, traveling at 12 m/s.
- Car1 approaches the VUT, changes to lane 2 to overtake, accelerates past the VUT, returns to lane 1, slows down, and then continues moving forward at a reduced speed until the end of the scene.
