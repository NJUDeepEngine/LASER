### Input Interpretation:

1. The ambulance is driving in a straight line on the highway at a high speed.
    - Reasoning: Ambulances typically move at high speeds during emergencies.

2. There are two vehicles in the same lane as the ambulance.
    - Reasoning: These vehicles are initially ahead of the ambulance.

3. When the distance between the ambulance and the vehicle in front is less than 20 meters, the vehicle in front moves to the side to make way.
    - Reasoning: Vehicles move aside to give way to the ambulance, adhering to traffic regulations.
