### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1:** 
An ambulance is driving on the highway at high speed. 
*Reasoning:* This sets the initial condition for the ambulance and establishes its presence on the highway.

**Stage 2:** 
There are two vehicles in the same lane ahead of the ambulance.
*Reasoning:* This introduces the vehicles that need to react to the approaching ambulance.

**Stage 3:** 
When the distance between the ambulance and the vehicle in front is less than 20 meters, the vehicle in front moves to either side to make way.
*Reasoning:* This describes the condition under which the vehicles in front will change lanes to allow the ambulance to pass.

**Stage 4:** 
After the vehicles move aside, the ambulance continues driving in a straight line.
*Reasoning:* This completes the sequence of events by describing the final state of the ambulance after the other vehicles have moved.

**Explanation:**

- **VUT** is the vehicle under test, starting in lane 1, 1000 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
- **Ambulance** starts in lane 1, 950 meters from the finish line, moving at 15 m/s, and aims to keep moving straight at high speed, triggering the vehicles in front to move aside when the distance is less than 20 meters.
- **Vehicle1** starts in lane 1, 900 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s, and will change lanes to make way for the ambulance when it comes within 20 meters.
- **Vehicle2** starts in lane 1, 850 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s, and will also change lanes to make way for the ambulance when it comes within 20 meters.
