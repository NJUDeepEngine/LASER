### Input Interpretation:
1. **Stage 1:** The ambulance is driving in a straight line at a high speed on the highway.
    - Reasoning: The ambulance is initially moving in its lane without any obstacles.
    
2. **Stage 2:** The ambulance approaches the first vehicle in the same lane.
    - Reasoning: The first vehicle is traveling ahead of the ambulance in the same lane.
    
3. **Stage 3:** When the distance between the ambulance and the first vehicle is less than 20 meters, the first vehicle moves to the side to make way for the ambulance.
    - Reasoning: The first vehicle detects the ambulance and moves to the side to allow the ambulance to pass.
    
4. **Stage 4:** The ambulance continues to drive straight and approaches the second vehicle.
    - Reasoning: The ambulance continues its high-speed travel in the same lane.

5. **Stage 5:** When the distance between the ambulance and the second vehicle is less than 20 meters, the second vehicle moves to the side to make way for the ambulance.
    - Reasoning: The second vehicle detects the ambulance and moves to the side to allow the ambulance to pass.

6. **Stage 6:** The ambulance continues to drive straight until the end of the scene.
    - Reasoning: The ambulance has passed both vehicles and continues its travel.
