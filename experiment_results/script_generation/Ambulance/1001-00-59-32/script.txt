### Explanation:

- **Ambulance (VUT)**: Initially starts in lane 2, 200 meters from the finish line, moving at a speed of 15 m/s.
- **Vehicle 1**: Starts in lane 2, 40 meters from the finish line, moving at a speed of 10 m/s. It will move to lane 1 when the ambulance is less than 20 meters away.
- **Vehicle 2**: Starts in lane 2, 60 meters from the finish line, moving at a speed of 10 m/s. It will move to lane 3 when the ambulance is less than 20 meters away.
