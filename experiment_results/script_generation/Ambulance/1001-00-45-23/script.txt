### Input Interpretation:

**Stage 1**: The ambulance is driving in a straight line at high speed in the same lane as two other vehicles.

- **Reasoning**: The initial setup involves an ambulance and two vehicles in the same lane on a 4-lane highway.

**Stage 2**: The ambulance approaches the vehicle in front, reducing the distance between them to less than 20 meters.

- **Reasoning**: This stage sets the condition that triggers the vehicles in front to make way for the ambulance.

**Stage 3**: The vehicles in front move to the sides to allow the ambulance to pass.

- **Reasoning**: When the ambulance is within 20 meters, the vehicles in front react by changing lanes.

**Stage 4**: The ambulance continues driving straight.

- **Reasoning**: After the vehicles move to the sides, the ambulance can continue its journey unobstructed.

In this scenario, the ambulance (VUT) is initially driving at high speed in lane 2. Two vehicles, `vehicle_1` and `vehicle_2`, are also in lane 2 but positioned ahead of the ambulance. When the ambulance approaches within 20 meters, `vehicle_1` moves to the left lane (lane 1), and `vehicle_2` moves to the right lane (lane 3), clearing the way for the ambulance to continue driving straight.
