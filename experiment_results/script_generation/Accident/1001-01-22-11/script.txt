### Input Interpretation:
1. Two cars experience a malfunction and come to a stop in lane 2, obstructing traffic.
2. Two other cars approach the stopped cars, slow down, and change lanes to avoid the obstruction.
3. The Vehicle Under Test (VUT) is one of the cars that approaches and avoids the stopped cars.

### Explanation:
1. **Car1** and **Car2** have experienced a malfunction and are stopped in lane 2 at 50 meters and 55 meters from the endpoint, respectively. They remain stationary throughout the scenario.
2. **Car3** approaches the stopped cars, slows down to 5 m/s, changes from lane 2 to lane 1 to avoid the stopped cars, and then continues forward at 10 m/s.
3. **Car4** follows a similar sequence: slowing down to 5 m/s, changing from lane 2 to lane 3 to avoid the stopped cars, and continuing forward at 10 m/s.
4. **VUT** starts in lane 2, 100 meters from the endpoint, with an initial speed of 10 m/s. It will follow a similar logic to **Car3** and **Car4** (though its specific steps were not provided, it would need to navigate around the stopped cars similarly).
