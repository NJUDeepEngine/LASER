### Input Interpretation:

1. **Stage 1**: Two cars have malfunctioned and are stopped in place in a lane. This is the initial cause for the scenario.
   - Reasoning: The malfunction of these cars creates an obstruction in the lane, requiring other vehicles to respond by slowing down or changing lanes.

2. **Stage 2**: The other two cars in the same lane approach the stopped cars and slow down.
   - Reasoning: These cars need to reduce their speed to avoid a collision with the stopped cars.

3. **Stage 3**: The other two cars change lanes to bypass the stopped cars.
   - Reasoning: After slowing down, the cars change lanes to continue their journey, avoiding the obstruction caused by the malfunctioned cars.

### Explanation:
- **VUT (Vehicle Under Test)**: This vehicle is moving in lane 1 and starts 100 meters from the endpoint with a speed of 10 m/s.
- **car1 and car2**: These are the malfunctioned cars in lane 2, stopped at 100 meters and 105 meters, respectively.
- **car3 and car4**: These cars are in lane 2, initially moving at 10 m/s. They slow down to avoid collision and then change lanes to lane 3 to bypass the stopped cars before continuing their journey.

The scenario ensures logical consistency and provides clear actions and termination conditions for each step.
