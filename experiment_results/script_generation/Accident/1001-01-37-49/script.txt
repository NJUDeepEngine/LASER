### Input Interpretation:

1. **Stage 1: Malfunction Occurrence**
   - Two cars (Car A and Car B) experience a malfunction and come to a stop in their respective lanes (Lane 2 and Lane 3).

2. **Stage 2: Initial Positions and Speed**
   - Car A is initially positioned in Lane 2, and Car B in Lane 3, both at a standstill.
   - Two other cars (Car C and Car D) are driving behind Car A and Car B in the same lanes respectively, and need to react.

3. **Stage 3: Reaction of Cars C and D**
   - Cars C and D slow down as they approach the stopped cars, then change lanes to avoid them.

4. **Stage 4: Lane Change and Continuation**
   - Car C changes from Lane 2 to Lane 1 to avoid Car A.
   - Car D changes from Lane 3 to Lane 4 to avoid Car B.
   - After changing lanes, Cars C and D continue to drive forward.

### Explanation:

- **Car A and Car B**: Both cars are malfunctioned and stop in their respective lanes (Lane 2 and Lane 3). They remain stationary for the rest of the scenario.
- **Car C**: Initially in Lane 2, Car C slows down to 5 m/s as it approaches the stopped Car A. It then changes lanes to Lane 1 to avoid Car A and continues driving forward at 15 m/s.
- **Car D**: Initially in Lane 3, Car D slows down to 5 m/s as it approaches the stopped Car B. It then changes lanes to Lane 4 to avoid Car B and continues driving forward at 15 m/s.
