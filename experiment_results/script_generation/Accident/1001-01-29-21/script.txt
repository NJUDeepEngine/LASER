### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1: Identification of malfunctioning cars**
- Two cars are stopped in place due to a malfunction.
- Reasoning: These cars are creating an obstacle in their lane.

**Stage 2: Identification of cars slowing down and changing lanes**
- Two other cars in the same lane notice the stopped cars and slow down.
- Reasoning: They need to change lanes to avoid the stopped cars.

**Stage 3: Lane change maneuver**
- The two cars that slowed down change lanes to avoid the stopped cars.
- Reasoning: This allows them to continue their journey without obstruction.

**Stage 4: Resumption of normal speed**
- After changing lanes, the cars resume normal speed.
- Reasoning: They are now in an unobstructed lane and can continue driving.
