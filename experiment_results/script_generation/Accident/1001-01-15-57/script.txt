### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1:** Two cars (Car1 and Car2) experience a malfunction and come to a complete stop in their respective lanes.
- **Reasoning:** This sets up the initial scenario where the malfunctioning cars block traffic.

**Stage 2:** Two other cars (Car3 and Car4) approach the stopped cars and slow down.
- **Reasoning:** Car3 and Car4 need to slow down to safely assess the situation and prepare to change lanes.

**Stage 3:** Car3 and Car4 change lanes to avoid the stopped cars and continue moving forward.
- **Reasoning:** To safely navigate around the stopped cars, Car3 and Car4 must change lanes.

### Explanation:
1. **VUT (Vehicle Under Test):** This is a placeholder car that remains stationary, representing a malfunctioning vehicle.
2. **Car1 and Car2:** Both cars are malfunctioning and remain stopped in their respective lanes (Lane 1 and Lane 2).
3. **Car3:** Initially in Lane 1, Car3 approaches the stopped Car1, slows down, changes to Lane 2, and continues moving forward.
4. **Car4:** Initially in Lane 2, Car4 approaches the stopped Car2, slows down, changes to Lane 3, and continues moving forward.
