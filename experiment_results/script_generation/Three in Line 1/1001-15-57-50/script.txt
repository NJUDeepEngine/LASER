**Input Interpretation:**

*Stage 1:* Two cars are driving in front of the VUT on a 4-lane road. This sets the scene with the VUT and two other cars ahead of it.

*Stage 2:* The car at the very front begins to slow down. This action causes the second car to react to avoid a collision.

*Stage 3:* The second car changes lanes to the right to avoid colliding with the slowing car in front. This maneuver involves the second car moving from its current lane to the adjacent right lane.

- **VUT**: The Vehicle Under Test starts in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, at a speed of 10 m/s.
- **car1**: The first car starts in lane 1, 120 meters from the finish line, at a speed of 10 m/s. It decelerates to a speed of 5 m/s and continues moving forward at that speed.
- **car2**: The second car starts in lane 1, 110 meters from the finish line, at a speed of 10 m/s. It changes lanes from lane 1 to lane 2 to avoid a collision with the slowing car in front and continues moving forward at 10 m/s in the new lane.
