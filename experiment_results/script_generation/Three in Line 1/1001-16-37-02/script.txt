### Input Interpretation:
1. The scenario begins with two cars in front of the VUT on a 4-lane road.
2. The car at the very front begins to slow down.
3. The second car, to avoid a collision, changes lanes to the right.
4. The VUT must respond to these actions.

### Explanation:
- **VUT**:
  - **Initial State**: It starts in lane 2, 50 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  
- **Front Car**:
  - **Initial State**: It starts in lane 2, 80 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - **Step 1**: Slow down to a speed not exceeding 5 m/s, with the termination condition being reaching 5 m/s. This action is to simulate slowing down and causing the second car to react.
  - **Step 2**: Move forward with a speed of 5 m/s until the end of the scenario.

- **Second Car**:
  - **Initial State**: It starts in lane 2, 65 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - **Step 1**: Change from lane 2 to lane 3, with the termination condition being the completion of the lane change. This action is to avoid a collision with the front car.
  - **Step 2**: Move forward with a speed of 10 m/s until the end of the scenario.
