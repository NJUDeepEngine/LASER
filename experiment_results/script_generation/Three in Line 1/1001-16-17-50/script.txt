### Input Interpretation

**Stage 1: Initial State of Vehicles**
- There are three vehicles on a 4-lane road: the VUT, Car1, and Car2.
- Car1 is at the very front, Car2 is behind Car1, and the VUT is behind Car2.
- All vehicles are traveling in the same lane initially.

**Stage 2: Car1 Slows Down**
- Car1 begins to reduce its speed for an unspecified reason.
- Car2 notices the reduction in speed of Car1 and needs to react to avoid a collision.

**Stage 3: Car2 Changes Lanes to the Right**
- To avoid colliding with Car1, Car2 changes lanes to the right (from its current lane to the lane to its right).
- Once in the right lane, Car2 will continue moving forward.

**Stage 4: VUT Continues Moving Forward**
- The VUT continues to move forward in its lane.

### Explanation

- **Initial States:**
  - The VUT starts in lane 1, 150 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Car1 starts in lane 1, 100 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.
  - Car2 starts in lane 1, 125 meters from the finish line, traveling at 10 m/s.

- **Car1's Actions:**
  - Car1 reduces its speed to 5 m/s due to an unspecified reason. This action stops when the speed reaches 5 m/s.
  - After slowing down, Car1 continues moving forward at 5 m/s until the end of the scene.

- **Car2's Actions:**
  - Car2 changes from lane 1 to lane 2 to avoid colliding with the slowing Car1. This action stops when Car2 is fully in lane 2.
  - After changing lanes, Car2 continues moving forward at 10 m/s until the end of the scene.

- **VUT's Actions:**
  - The VUT continues moving forward in lane 1 at 10 m/s until the end of the scene.
