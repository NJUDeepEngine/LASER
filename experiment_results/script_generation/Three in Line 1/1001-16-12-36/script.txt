### Input Interpretation:
1. The scene begins with two cars in front of the VUT. The initial state involves all vehicles moving along the same lane.
2. The car at the very front decelerates, which triggers a response from the second car.
3. The second car, to avoid a collision, changes lanes to the right.
4. Meanwhile, the VUT continues to move in its lane.

            },
            {

    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - The VUT is in lane 2, 100 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
   - Car1 is in lane 2, 120 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.
   - Car2 is in lane 2, 110 meters from the finish line, moving at 10 m/s.

2. **Stages for Car1**:
   - Stage 1: Decelerate to 5 m/s to simulate slowing down.
   - Stage 2: Continue moving straight at 5 m/s.

3. **Stages for Car2**:
   - Stage 1: Change lanes from lane 2 to lane 3 to avoid collision.
   - Stage 2: Continue moving straight at 10 m/s in lane 3.

4. **VUT**:
   - The VUT continues to move in its lane without changing speed or lane.

This detailed scenario description ensures that the actions of each actor are clear, logically consistent, and follow the sequence of events described in the brief test case.
