## Input Interpretation

**Stage 1**: 
The car at the very front (Car 1) begins to slow down. 
- **Reasoning**: This initiates the chain of events and creates the need for the car behind it (Car 2) to react.

**Stage 2**: 
The second car (Car 2), to avoid a collision with Car 1, changes lanes to the right. 
- **Reasoning**: Car 2 needs to avoid a collision with Car 1, hence it changes lanes to maintain safety.

**Stage 3**: 
The VUT continues to move forward, adjusting its speed as necessary to maintain safe distances. 
- **Reasoning**: The VUT will need to react to the changes in traffic dynamics caused by the actions of Car 1 and Car 2.
